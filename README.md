# E Wallet Product and Transaction Analysis_Python
Analyzed e-wallet transactions to identify product performance trends, transaction behaviors, and optimize business decisions.

## I/ Introduction
### 1. Dataset 
The dataset comes from an e-wallet company, containing the following tables:
- payment_report.csv: Monthly payment volume for each product.
- product.csv: Product information, including product ID and team ownership.
- transactions.csv: Transaction details such as transaction type, merchant ID, and amount.
### 2. Objective

The company is facing challenges in understanding product performance and transaction behaviors across its e-wallet platform. As a Data Analyst, my task is to analyze the datasets to identify trends in payment volumes, ensure product ownership aligns with company rules, and categorize transaction types. 
The insights gathered will help pinpoint top-selling products, address potential issues in product management, and provide a clearer picture of how users engage with different types of transactions. This analysis will support more informed business decisions aimed at improving product strategies and operational efficiency.
